Handlers
========

Handlers are the classes that provide the methods for interacting with the Authentrics API.
Use the handlers built into the :doc:`client` to make standard requests to the API.
If you need to make a custom request, use the get/post/etc. methods inherited from the :doc:`BaseClient <base_client>` class.
